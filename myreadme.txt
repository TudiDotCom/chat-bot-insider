I know there are bugs due to my ".includes()" functions when comparing the names of the strings. I left it like this to make testing easier.
I should probably implement an algorithm to test "how much" the strings are alike, but I
was past the 2 hours (maybe Levenshtein distance) and then send a message with a proposal("Did you want to say ...?")
